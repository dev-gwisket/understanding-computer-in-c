A letter for C learners

\clearpage

Hello, welcome to ``Understanding Computer in C''!

When I was a kid, C was the first-learning programming language. As the
time passes, the first-learning programming language has been changing to
Python, Javascript, etc. Even though Python and other programming
languages are easy to learn and have a high productivity, C is considered
as an important programming language to learn things beyond the code, for
example, managing memory.

Some people say ``C is old'' and ``C is complicated''. Yes, they are
right. C is old and complicated so that the programmers should consider
many things unlike other programming languages. However, C is still
beautiful and will be beautiful forever.

As you've seen, the name of this book is ``Understanding Computer in C''.
As the name suggests, this book is for people who wants to learn how
computer works. If you only want to learn C or need a quick overview of C,
please learn C with other books, unless you will find this book too
detailed and complicated.

If you are reading this paragraph, which means you have an interest on
this book, let's dive in to C!
