\section{Why Should I Learn C?}

Since C is made to implement an operating system, it has many features
that enables you to access memory, files, et cetera directly. Which means,
you would learn how memory works, how files are saved, et cetera, and
finally how computer works.

You might do not think that knowing how the computer works is important
because the abstractions of programming languages such as Python works
well without knowing how computer works. However, it doesn't because, even
if you are using programming languages such as Python, knowing how the
computer works allows you to choose more appropriate data structures or
write more faster algorithms. Lastly, I have to say that the biggest
reason why you should learn it is because it is fun!
