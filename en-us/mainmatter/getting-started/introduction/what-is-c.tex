\section{What is C?}

Before we start, we should know what the C programming language is. C is
a programming language created in 1970s by Dennis Ritchie for
reimplementing Unix kernel. Before appearance of C, operating systems
tended to be implemented using Assembly Language which is a set of string
mappings against Machine Code. Since Assembly Language is
processor-dependent, operating systems and programs must be programmed per
processor. C uses compiler to \emph{generate} Machine Codes, which made
codes be able to be processor-independent.
