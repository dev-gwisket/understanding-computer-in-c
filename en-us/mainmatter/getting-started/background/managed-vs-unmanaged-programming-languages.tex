\section{Managed vs. Unmanaged Programming Languages}

An \emph{unmanaged} programming language is a programming language which
programmers should manage memory directly. Programmers are responsible to
allocate and free the memory.

A \emph{managed} programming language is a programming language which
programmers don't need to take care of memory. Instead, a program called
GC(garbage collector) frees memory automatically.

For unmanaged programming languages, programmers should take care of using
memory, which introduces higher probability of memory leaks. However,
since it does not contain GC, the programs are generally more lightweight.
For managed programming languages, vice versa.
