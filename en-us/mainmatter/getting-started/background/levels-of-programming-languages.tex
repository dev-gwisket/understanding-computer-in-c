\section{Levels of Programming Languages}

In a sense of programming language, level does \emph{not} mean which
programming language is better or worse, but how much the language is
human-friendly. For example, Python has higher level than C because Python
requires less knowledge about how computer works than C. In other words,
Python is more abstracted than C.

Programming languages can be classified into two categories by how
human-friendly the language is: \emph{high-level languages} and
\emph{low-level languages}.

As I have mentioned, high-level languages are more human-friendly than
low-level languages. Then, what languages are high-level languages and are
low-level languages? In a strict sense, there is only one low-level
language; machine code. Any other languages are high-level languages.
However, as more abstracted languages appear, programming languages such
as C are often considered as low-level languages.
